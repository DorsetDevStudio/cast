# cast

Please note that the iOS part is not done for now. 
As a dotnet developer It is already hard enough to learn Kotlin for the Android part...
If someone is interested to port the code on iOS let me know, otherwise maybe I will do it later when this plugin is more mature.

This Flutter plugin is very new and unfinished. More to come.
The example app do it all.
1. Discover the chromecast device with the chromecast button.
2. Choose which video you want to play and hit the play button
3. You can play, pause, resume and Disconnect.
4. There is and event to know when the media is finished.
