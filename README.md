# cast

Please note that the iOS part is not done. The problem is that you need and apple developer account to develop that. I don't have that and I don't plan to buy only for a hobby. What I did is that the project for iOS is setup and ready to be develop, but you need the Access WIFI Capability that is only available for your app when you have a paid apple developer account.   
If someone have an account and is interested let just fork the project and do it

This Flutter plugin is very new and unfinished. More to come.
The example app do it all.
1. Change the receiverConst value in example/lib/receiverConsts.dart, you need a valid chromecast App id there to make the example work. You can create a receiver app there: https://cast.google.com/publish .
2. Discover the chromecast device with the chromecast button.
3. Choose which video you want to play and hit the play button
4. You can play, pause, resume and Disconnect.
5. There is and event to know when the media is finished.
