# cast

Please note that the iOS part is not done for now. 
As a dotnet developer It is already hard enough to learn Kotlin for the Android part...
If someone is interested to port the code on iOS let me know, otherwise maybe I will do it later when this plugin is more mature.

This Flutter plugin is very new and unfinished. More to come.
The example app do it all.
1. Discover the chromecast device with the chromecast button.
2. Tap on the device and It will play a video.
3. Disconnect.
4. If you leave the app, It will remove the callback event and when you resume It put back the event.
